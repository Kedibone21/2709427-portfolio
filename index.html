    <h2> About me </h2>
     <p> I am a tech fanatic! I love solving problems using algorithms and building things from scratch using either old solutions or new profound algorithms. I am quite adaptable and very open to learning.</p>
     
     <p>I love putting my work on github as it makes things easier for me and as it as well enables me to work with friends.</p>
     <p>I love watching SciFi series</p>

     <h3>Latest Project</h3>
     <p>A tech project that we once did was building a social app named Woofer built using Android. It had a front where the user can sign up using their email and they would get an email that their sign up was successful. After entering the app, users can message other users, add friends, add status updates and/or upvote other peoples' updates. </p>
